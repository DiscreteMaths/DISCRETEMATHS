\subsection{Significant Digits}
There are three rules on determining how many significant figures are in a number: Non-zero digits are always significant. Any zeros between two significant digits are significant. A final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.

\section{Floating Point Notation}



In computing, floating point describes a method of 
representing an approximation of a real number in a 
way that can support a wide range of values. 


The numbers are, in general, represented approximately 
to a fixed number of significant digits (the mantissa) and scaled using an exponent. 

In essence, computers are integer machines and are capable of representing real numbers only by using complex codes. The most popular code for representing real numbers is called the IEEE Floating-Point Standard .
The term floating point is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; that is, the decimal point can float. There are also representations in 
which the number of digits before and after the decimal point is set, called fixed-point representations. In general, floating-point representations are slower and less accurate than fixed-point representations, but they can handle a larger range of numbers.
