\emph{(2008 Q3b)}\\
Construct a logic network that accepts as input p and q, which may independently have the value 0 or 1, and
gives as final input $\neg(p \wedge \not q)$ (i.e. $\equiv p \rightarrow q$).\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Logical "AND" ($\wedge$)
\item Logical "OR" ($\vee$)
\item Logical "NOT" 
\end{itemize}

\emph{\textbf{Examiner's Comments:}Many
diagrams were carefully and clearly drawn and well labelled, gaining full
marks. The logic table was also well done by most, but there were a few marks
lost in the final part by failing to deduce that ‘since the columns of the table are
identical the expressions are equivalent’.}
