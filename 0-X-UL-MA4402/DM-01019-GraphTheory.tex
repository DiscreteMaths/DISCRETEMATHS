\subsection{Question 6}
 The following adjacency matrix shows several European countries and an entry of 1 indicates the countries concerned share a common border, whereas a zero entry indicates they do not. 
Austria Belgium France Germany Italy 
( 
Austria Belgium France Germany Italy o 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 o 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 
(i) Write down the countries which share a border with Germany. (ii) Is this matrix symmetric or not? Give an example to show what this means. (iii) Draw the graph. G, associated with this matrix. (iv) Explain how the number of edges of the graph can be calculated from the entries in the matrix and find this number. (v) Draw another graph, H, which has 5 vertices and the same degree sequence as G but is not isomorphic to it. Give a reason why G and H are not isomorphic. [6]
