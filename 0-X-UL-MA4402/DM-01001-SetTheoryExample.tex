\section*{Set Operations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Union ($\cup$) - also known as the \textbf{OR} operator. A union signifies a bringing together. The union of the sets A and B consists of the elements that are in either A or B.
\item Intersection ($\cap$) - also known as the \textbf{AND} operator. An intersection is where two things meet. The intersection of the sets A and B consists of the elements that in both A and B.
\item Complement ($A^{\prime}$ or $A^{c}$) - The complement of the set A consists of all of the elements in the universal set that are not elements of A.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Exercise}
Consider the universal set $U$ such that
\[U=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} \] 
and the sets
\[A=\{2,5,7,9\} \] 
\[B=\{2,4,6,8,9\} \]

\item[(a)] $A-B$
\item[(b)] $A \otimes B$
\item[(c)] $A \cap B$
\item[(d)] $A \cup B$
\item[(e)] $A^{\prime} \cap B^{\prime}$
\item[(f)] $A^{\prime} \cup B^{\prime}$
