\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item Describe how such it communications netw•it can be modelled by a gray d,. saying what the vertices represent and a rule for determining when two verticcE are adjacent. 
\item  Calculate how many pairs of cities have P. direct coach link between giving a brief explanation of your method. Whet is meant by saying that a graph is • rtpl,.? Say why a graph model of this communications. ner•:,-)rk would be sin...pita..
