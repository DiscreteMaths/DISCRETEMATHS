
\subsection*{Question 6 Part A : Digraphs}

Suppose $A = $$\{1,2,3,4\}$. Consider the following relation in A

\[ \{  (1,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,2),(4,4)\} \]

Draw the direct graph of $A$. Based on the Digraph of $A$ discuss whether or not a relation that could be depicted by the digraph could be described as the following, justifying your answer.


\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Symmetric
	\item[(ii)] Reflexive 
	\item[(iii)] Transitive
	\item[(iv)] Antisymmetric
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Part B : Relations}
Determine which of the following relations $ x R y$ are reflexive, transitive, symmetric, or antisymmetric on the following - there may be more than one characteristic.  if

\begin{itemize} 
	\item[(i)] $x = y$
	\item[(ii)] $x < y$
	\item[(iii)] $x^2 = y^2$
	\item[(iv)] $x \geq y$
\end{itemize}
