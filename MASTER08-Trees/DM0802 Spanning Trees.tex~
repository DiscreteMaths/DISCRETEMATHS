\subsection*{Spanning Trees}
A spanning tree T of a connected, undirected graph G is a tree composed of all the vertices and some (or perhaps all) of the edges of G. Informally, a spanning tree of G is a selection of edges of G that form a tree spanning every vertex.


 That is, every vertex lies in the tree, but no cycles (or loops) are formed. On the other hand, every bridge of G must belong to T.
