(a) A sequence is given by the recurrence relation
\[un+1 = un + n \]and u1 = 0.
% (i) Calculate u3, u4, and u5. [2]
(ii) Use induction to prove that
un =
n(n - 1)
2
forall n = 1.

) Another sequence is defined by the recurrence relation un = un-1+ 2n-1 and
u1 = 1.
% (i) Calculate u2, u3, u4 and u5.
(ii) Prove by induction that un = n
