German mathematician G. Cantor introduced the concept of sets. He had defined a set as a collection of definite and distinguishable objects selected by the means of certain rules or description.

Set theory forms the basis of several other fields of study like counting theory, relations, graph theory and finite state machines. In this chapter, we will cover the different aspects of Set Theory.


\subsection{Representation of a Set}
Sets can be represented in two ways −

Roster or Tabular Form
Set Builder Notation

%=====================================================%
Roster or Tabular Form
The set is represented by listing all the elements comprising it. The elements are enclosed within braces and separated by commas.

Example 1 − Set of vowels in English alphabet, A={a,e,i,o,u}A={a,e,i,o,u}
Example 2 − Set of odd numbers less than 10, B={1,3,5,7,9}B={1,3,5,7,9}
Set Builder Notation
The set is defined by specifying a property that elements of the set have in common. The set is described as A={x:p(x)}A={x:p(x)}
Example 1 − The set {a,e,i,o,u}{a,e,i,o,u} is written as −

\[A={x:x is a vowel in English alphabet}\]
%=====================================================%
\subsubsection*{Example 2} − The set ${1,3,5,7,9}$ is written as −

B={x:1\leqx<10 and (x%2)≠0}B={x:1\leqx<10 and (x%2)≠0}
If an element x is a member of any set S, it is denoted by x∈Sx∈S and if an element y is not a member of set S, it is denoted by y∉Sy∉S.

Example − If S={1,1.2,1.7,2},1∈SS={1,1.2,1.7,2},1∈S but 1.5∉S
%=====================================================%
\subsection{Some Important Sets}
\begin{itemize}
\item N − the set of all natural numbers = {1,2,3,4,.....}
\item Z − the set of all integers = {.....,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,.....}
\item Z+ − the set of all positive integers
\item Q − the set of all rational numbers
\item R − the set of all real numbers
\item W − the set of all whole numbers
\end{itemize}

Venn Diagrams
Venn diagram, invented in 1880 by John Venn, is a schematic diagram that shows all possible logical relations between different mathematical sets.

Examples

Venn Diagram


Bell Numbers
Bell numbers give the count of the number of ways to partition a set. They are denoted by BnBn where n is the cardinality of the set.

Example −

Let S={1,2,3}S={1,2,3}, n=|S|=3n=|S|=3
The alternate partitions are −

1. ∅,{1,2,3}∅,{1,2,3}

2. {1},{2,3}{1},{2,3}

3. {1,2},{3}{1,2},{3}

4. {1,3},{2}{1,3},{2}

5. {1},{2},{3}{1},{2},{3}

Hence B3=5

\subsection*{Union and intersection of sets}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{union} of two sets A and B is a set containing all the elements in
either A or B (or both)
i.e. 
\[A \cup B = {x / x \in A \mbox{ or } x \in B}.\]
\item The \textbf{intersection} of two sets A and B is a set containing all the elements
that are both in A and B
i.e. 
\[A \cap B = {x / x \in A \mbox{ and }x \in B}\].

\item If sets A and B have no elements in common, i.e. $A \cap B = \emptyset$,then A and B
are termed \textbf{disjoint sets}.
