\section*{Set Operations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Union ($\cup$) - also known as the \textbf{OR} operator. A union signifies a bringing together. The union of the sets A and B consists of the elements that are in either A or B.
\item Intersection ($\cap$) - also known as the \textbf{AND} operator. An intersection is where two things meet. The intersection of the sets A and B consists of the elements that in both A and B.
\item Complement ($A^{\prime}$ or $A^{c}$) - The complement of the set A consists of all of the elements in the universal set that are not elements of A.
\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection*{Complements}
\begin{itemize}

\item The Complements of A and B are the elements of the universal set not contained in A and B.

\item The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$
\[ \mathcal{A}^{\prime} = \{4,6,8,9\}, \]
\[ \mathcal{B}^{\prime} = \{1,3,5,7,9\}, \]

\end{itemize}

%--------------------------------------------------------%

\subsubsection*{Intersection}
\begin{itemize}

\item Intersection of two sets describes the elements that are members of both the specified Sets

\item The intersection is denoted $\mathcal{A\cap B}$ 
\[ \mathcal{A\cap B} = \{2\}\]

\item only one element is a member of both A and B.
\end{itemize}
%--------------------------------------------------------%

\subsubsection*{Set Difference}
\begin{itemize}

\item The Set Difference of A with regard to B are list of elements of A not contained by B.

\item The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A-B}$ and $\mathcal{B-A}$
\[ \mathcal{A-B} = \{1,3,5,7\}, \]

\[ \mathcal{B-A} = \{4,6,8\}, \]
\end{itemize}





%--------------------------------------------------------%
\subsubsection*{Relative Difference}
\begin{itemize}
\item $ A \oplus B$
\end{itemize}
