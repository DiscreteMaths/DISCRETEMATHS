\begin{itemize}
\item Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.
\item The \textbf{cartesian product} $X \times Y$ is the set whose elements are \textbf{all} of 
the ordered pairs of elements $(x,y)$ where $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let $X = \{a,b,c\}$
\item Let $Y = \{0,1\}$ 
\item The cartesian product $X \times Y$ is therefore:
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Importantly $X \times Y \neq Y \times X$
\item Recall: Let $X = \{a,b,c\}$ and let $Y = \{0,1\}$ 
\item The cartesian product $Y \times X$ is therefore:
\end{itemize}



Discrete Maths

A binary relation on a set A is the collection of ordered pairs of elements of A. In other words, it is the subset of the cartesian product A2= AA

Cartesian Product

This is a direct product pf 2 sets

XY = {(x,y)| xXandyY }
