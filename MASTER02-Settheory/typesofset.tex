\section*{The Universal Set and the Empty Set}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first is the \textbf{\textit{universal set}}, typically denoted $U$. This set is all of the elements that we may choose from. This set may be different from one setting to the next. 

\item For example one universal set may be the set of all real numbers, denoted $\mathbb{R}$, whereas for another problem the universal set may be the whole numbers $\{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}$.

\item The other set that requires consideration is called the \textit{\textbf{empty set}}. The empty set is the unique set is the set with no elements. We write this as $\{ \}$ and denote this set by $\emptyset$.
\end{itemize}
