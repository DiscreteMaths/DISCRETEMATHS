\item[5A.3] Isomorphisms of a graph
\item[5A.4] Adjacency Matrices and Adjacency Lists
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Isomorphism}
\begin{itemize}
\item They have a different number of connected components
\item They have a different number of vertices
\item They have different degrees sequences
\item They have a different number of paths of any given length
\item They have a different number of cycles of any length.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adjacency Lists}
\begin{itemize}
\item[u]: $\{v\}$
\item[v]: $\{w,x\}$
\item[w]: $\{v,x\}$
\item[z]: $\{v,w\}$
\end{itemize}




\begin{itemize}
\item Spanning Subgraphs of G.

\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ isolated vertex}} if it has a degree of zero.
\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ end-vertex}} if it has a degree of one.
\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ even vertex}} if it has a degree of an even number.
\item a vertex is said to be an \textbf{emph{ odd vertex}} if it has a degree of an odd number.


\item A graph is said to be \textbf{emph{k-regular}} if the degree of each vertex is $k$. 
\item Every Graph has an even number of odd vertices.
\item A cubic graph is a graph where every vertex has degree three.
