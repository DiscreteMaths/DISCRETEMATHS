\frametitle{Introduction to Graph Theory}
Graph theory is the study of points and lines. In particular, it involves the ways in which sets of points, called \textit{\textbf{vertices}}, can be connected by lines or arcs, called \textit{\textbf{edges}}.

Graphs are classified according to their complexity, the number of edges allowed between any two vertices, and whether or not directions (for example, up or down) are assigned to edges.
