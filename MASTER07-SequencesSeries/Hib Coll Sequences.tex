Let the sequence $u_n$ be defined by the recurrence relation:
\[ u_{n+1} = u_n + 2n, \]
\\ \bigskip
for $n=1,2,3,\ldots$. \\ \bigskip Initial Condition: $u_1=1$.\\ \bigskip Calculate $u_2$, $u_3$, $u_4$ and $u_5$, showing all your workings.

Starting with $n=1$,
\[ u_{n+1} = u_n + 2n, \]
\[ u_{(1)+1} = u_{1} + 2\times 1, \]
\[ u_{2} = 1 + 2, \]
\[ u_{2} = 3. \]

With $n=2$,
\[ u_{n+1} = u_n + 2n, \]
\[ u_{(2)+1} = u_{2} + 2\times 2, \]
\[ u_{3} = 3 + 4, \]
\[ u_{3} = 7. \]

With $n=3$,
\[ u_{n+1} = u_n + 2n, \]
\[ u_{(3)+1} = u_{3} + 2\times 3, \]
\[ u_{4} = 7 + 6, \]
\[ u_{4} = 13. \]

With $n=4$,
\[ u_{n+1} = u_n + 2n, \]
\[ u_{(4)+1} = u_{4} + 2\times 4, \]
\[ u_{5} = 13 + 8, \]
\[ u_{5} = 21. \]

The first five elements of the sequence are as follows:
\[ \{1,3,7,13,21, \ldots\}
\]
