\frametitle{Rational and Irrational Numbers}
You can tell if it is Rational or Irrational by trying to write the number as a simple fraction.
\begin{itemize}
\item  1.5 is rational, because it can be written as the ratio 3/2
\item  7 is rational, because it can be written as the ratio 7/1
\item  0.333... (3 repeating) is also rational, because it can be written as the ratio 1/3
\end{itemize}
