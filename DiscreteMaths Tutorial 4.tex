If f is a function for which the rule is f(x) = 7/8  - x, where x is real, the rule for the inverse function f-1 is:
A	f -1(x) = 8/7 + x
B	f -1(x) = -8/x + 7 
C	f -1(x) = 2x + 73/4 
D	f -1(x) = 7/8 - x  (This one)
E	f -1(x) = 8/7 + x

Which of the following functions is not one-to-one?
A	f(x) = 9 - x2, x \geq 0
B	f(x) = 1/x^2  - 9  (This one)
C	f(x) = 1 -9x
D	f(x) = \sqrt{x} 
E	f(x) = 3/x 
The range of the function with rule f(x) = |x - 4| + 3 is:
A	(4, \infty)
B	R
C	[3, \infty) This one
D	(4, \infty)
E	(-1, \infty)

Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4} and Y={A,B,C,D}. Determine whether each relation is a function, with X -> Y.
(a) f = {(2, C), (1, D), (2, A), (3,B), (4, D)}

No:  Two different ordered pairs (2, C) and (2, A) in f have the same number 2 as their first coordinate

Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4}. Determine whether the following relation on X is a function.

(b) g = {(3, A), (4, B), (1, C)}

No The element 2 does not appear as the first coordinate in any ordered pair in g.
