V. Bain invented an algorithm to draw the n-cube in the plane. In the algorithm,
all vertices are on the unit-circle in the xy-plane. The angle of a point is the angle
from the positive x-axis counterclockwise to the ray from the origin to the point. The
input is n.
%========================================================================================================= %
1. If n = 0, put an unlabelled vertex at (􀀀1; 0) and stop.
2. Recursively invoke this algorithm with input n 􀀀 1.
3. Move each vertex so that its new angle is half the current angle, maintaining edge
connections.
4. Re
ect each vertex and edge in the x-axis.
5. Connect each vertex above the x-axis to its mirror below the x-axis.
6. Prex 0 to the label of each vertex above the x-axis, and similarly with 1 below.
Use this algorithm to draw a 4-cube.
