\section{1.7 Venn diagrams}
Often the relationships that exist between sets can best be shown using a
Venn diagram. To construct a Venn diagram we let a certain region, usually
a rectangle, represent the universal set. 

This rectangle is often implied
by the constraints of the page and only in those circumstances where its
boundary is important is the rectangle drawn (see the diagrams below for
example). Individual sets are then represented by regions, often circles,
within this rectangle. One can then easily depict intersections, unions,
complements, etc. on the diagram. For example:
